# SU2_GUI

--Description--

This project is designed to provide an easy and user-friendly interface to SU2. With this software, the user can easily solve a variety of surface-flow equations and get immediate visual feedback. It currently supports Unix-based operating systems.

--Installation--

This software is an interface for <strong>SU2</strong>.

You will need to have installed SU2 (guide for installation can be found on https://github.com/su2code/SU2/wiki/Build-from-Source), including assigning the environment variables.

Place SU2_GUI.jar and the folder su2 (which will be the location of all SU2-native resources involved) in the same directory.

The bin files are probably outdated.  If you want the latest version, which may contain bugs, you will need to download the src files and compile them.

--Todo--

Add compatibility with Windows.  This means editing methods which run command-line functions and which access and edit files.
